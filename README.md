# Introduction 

In this project we will learn how to implement an APC Design Architecture (Application, Page, Control) in our Xamarin Forms application.

# Getting Started

The APC Architecture is based on the use of Styles which could be stored on the Application resources, Page resources or Control properties.
We will group the styles by the functionality, so the best type is Explicit styles.
